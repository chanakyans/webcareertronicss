        <h1>Shipping and Delivery Policy for Careertronic Global Services
        </h1>
        <p>Effective Date: 10th December 2024</p>
        
    </header>
    <section class="content">
        <p>
            At Careertronic Global Services, we provide custom software development services designed to meet the unique needs of our clients. As our services are primarily digital in nature, our Shipping and Delivery Policy outlines how we deliver the final products, including software applications, code, documentation, and other related deliverables, to our clients. By engaging our services, you agree to the terms and conditions set forth in this policy.
        </p>
        <h2>1. Delivery of Digital Products
        </h2>
        <p>Since the services we provide are digital (software applications, websites, mobile apps, code, etc.), there is no physical shipping involved. Instead, the delivery of the final products will be done through secure, digital means.
        </p>
        <strong>a. Delivery Methods</strong>
        <p>Deliverables will be provided to the Client using one of the following methods:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Secure File Transfer:</strong> We may provide access to a secure file-sharing platform (such as Dropbox, Google Drive, or a similar service) where the final deliverables can be downloaded.

            </li>
            <li><strong>Project Management Platforms:</strong>  If the project is being tracked via a project management tool (such as Jira, Trello, or Asana), we will upload final files or deliverables directly to the tool for download.

            </li>
            <li><strong>Direct Email or FTP:</strong>If applicable, we may send the final deliverables via email or FTP (File Transfer Protocol) directly to the Client.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Code Repository Access:</strong> For software projects, we may grant the Client access to the project’s source code repository (e.g., GitHub, Bitbucket) to download the code.

            </li>
        </ul>
        <strong>a. Delivery Timeline</strong>
 
        <ul>
            <li> The estimated delivery timeline for each project will be specified in the Statement of Work (SOW) or Project Contract between Careertronic Global Services and the Client.

            </li>
            <li>Delivery timelines depend on the complexity and scope of the project. We strive to meet agreed-upon delivery dates; however, delivery may be subject to delays due to unforeseen circumstances (such as client delays, technical challenges, or external dependencies).

            </li>
            <li>Upon completion of each project phase, we will notify the Client and provide them with the deliverables within the agreed timeframe, or as otherwise specified in the contract.

            </li>
           
        </ul>
        <h2>2. Deliverables
        </h2>
        <p>
            Deliverables may include, but are not limited to:

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Software Products:</strong> Web applications, mobile applications, desktop software, APIs, or any other custom-developed software.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Source Code:</strong> The underlying code that powers the application or software.

            </li>
            <li><strong>Design Assets:</strong>UI/UX designs, wireframes, mockups, and other design materials.

                <li><strong>Documentation:</strong>Technical documentation, user manuals, API documentation, and other relevant documents that accompany the software.

                </li>
                <li><strong>Licenses and Keys:</strong>  Software licenses, access credentials, or activation keys for third-party tools, APIs, or services used during development.

                </li>
                <p>All deliverables will be provided in the format agreed upon in the Statement of Work (SOW) or contract, unless otherwise discussed.
                </p>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Client Responsibilities Upon Delivery
        </h2>
        <p>
            Upon receipt of deliverables, the Client is responsible for the following:

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Review of Deliverables:</strong> The Client should review the final deliverables to ensure they meet the agreed-upon requirements, features, and quality standards.

            <li><strong>Feedback and Approval:</strong> If the Client requires any modifications or revisions, they must provide feedback within the agreed-upon review period. The Client’s approval is required for the formal completion of the project.

            </li>
            <li><strong>Testing and Quality Assurance:</strong> While Careertronic Global Services conducts extensive testing during development, the Client should conduct their own testing and quality assurance checks. Any bugs or issues identified during testing should be communicated to Careertronic Global Services promptly for resolution.
            </li>
               
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Late Deliveries and Delays</h2>
        <p>
            While we make every effort to deliver your project on time, delays may occur due to various reasons, including:

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Client Delays:</strong>Delays in receiving feedback, approval, or resources from the Client (e.g., access to third-party accounts, content, etc.) can impact project timelines.

            <li><strong>Technical Challenges:</strong> Unforeseen technical challenges or issues that arise during development may cause delays.

            </li>
            <li><strong>External Dependencies:</strong> If the project relies on third-party services, tools, or resources (e.g., API integrations, licensing approvals, etc.), any delays from external providers can affect our delivery timeline.

            </li>
               <p>
                If a delay occurs, Careertronic Global Services will notify the Client immediately and provide an updated estimated delivery date. We will make every effort to minimize delays and communicate effectively throughout the process.
               </p>
        </ul>
        <h2>5. Final Acceptance and Ownership of Deliverables
        </h2>
        <p>
            Once the deliverables are provided and reviewed:

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Final Acceptance:</strong>The Client must formally accept the final project deliverables as outlined in the project agreement. The acceptance period typically ranges from [Insert Number of Days] to [Insert Number of Days] days from the delivery date.

            <li><strong>Ownership:</strong>Upon final acceptance and receipt of full payment, ownership of the deliverables (including software, code, and intellectual property rights) will be transferred to the Client as specified in the Terms and Conditions or Service Agreement.

            </li>
            <li><strong>License to Use:</strong> If applicable, the Client will be granted a license to use third-party tools, libraries, or software integrated into the project, subject to the terms and conditions set by those third-party providers.
            </li>
             
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Support and Maintenance
        </h2>
        <p>
            After the project is delivered and accepted, Careertronic Global Services may offer ongoing support and maintenance services as part of the contract or through a separate agreement. This can include:
            </p>
            <li><strong>Bug Fixes:</strong>Correcting any defects or issues discovered after delivery.

            </li>
            <li><strong>Updates and Enhancements:</strong>Updating the software for new features, security patches, or other improvements as agreed upon.

            </li>
            <li><strong>Training and Documentation:</strong> Providing further training or updates to documentation if needed.

                </li>
               <p>Support and maintenance terms, including pricing and scope, will be outlined in a separate Service Level Agreement (SLA) if applicable.
            </p>
               
        </ul>
       
        <h2>7.Delivery of Updates and Enhancements</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Post-Launch Updates:</strong>Careertronic Global Services may provide updates or enhancements to the software following delivery. These updates can include performance improvements, new features, security patches, or bug fixes, and will be delivered in the same way as the initial deliverables.

            <li><strong>Version Control:</strong> For ongoing projects, Careertronic Global Services may use version control systems (e.g., Git) to manage changes and updates. The Client will be notified when a new version or update is available for download.

            </li>
        </ul>
