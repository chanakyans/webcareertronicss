    <h1>Cancellation and Refund Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 10th December 2024</p>
    <p>At Careertronic Global Services, we strive to provide the best possible experience and value for our clients. This Cancellation and Refund Policy outlines the terms under which services may be canceled, and how refunds will be handled in the case of cancellation. By engaging our services, you agree to the terms set forth in this policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Cancellation of Services</h2>
    <h3>a. Cancellation by the Client</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Notice Requirement:</strong> If you wish to cancel a service, you must provide written notice to us at least 15 days before the intended cancellation date.</li>
        <li><strong>Project Phase and Timing:</strong> If the project is already in progress, the ability to cancel and any associated costs will depend on the phase of the project (e.g., design, development, testing, deployment).</li>
        <li><strong>Pre-Development (Initial Phase):</strong> If cancellation occurs before work on the project has started, you will be refunded the deposit, minus any non-refundable initial consultation or setup fees.</li>
        <li><strong>In-Progress Projects:</strong> If cancellation occurs after work has begun, the Client will be responsible for paying for all work completed up to the cancellation date. A partial refund or credit will be considered based on the remaining scope of work, but no refund will be issued for non-refundable fees or milestones already completed.</li>
        <li><strong>Completed Projects:</strong> If the project has been completed and delivered to the Client, no refunds will be provided unless the work is deemed incomplete or defective, as outlined below.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>b. Cancellation by Careertronic Global Services</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Careertronic Global Services reserves the right to cancel or suspend services if the Client:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Fails to make payments in accordance with the agreed payment terms.</li>
            <li>Provides inadequate or misleading information that affects the successful completion of the project.</li>
            <li>Violates the terms of the service agreement, including but not limited to breaching intellectual property rights, non-cooperation, or unethical conduct.</li>
            <li>Requests unreasonable modifications to the scope of work after the project has commenced.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>In the event of cancellation by Careertronic Global Services, the Client will be entitled to a refund for any unearned fees, as determined by the work completed up to the date of cancellation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Refund Policy</h2>
    <h3>a. Refund Eligibility</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pre-Development (Initial Phase):</strong> If you cancel the service before work has started (after initial consultation but before development begins), we will provide a partial refund of any upfront payment or deposit, minus any non-refundable consultation or setup fees.</li>
        <li><strong>In-Progress Projects:</strong> If you cancel after development has begun, you are entitled to a partial refund based on the work completed at the time of cancellation. The refund amount will be determined by the percentage of work completed and the specific terms outlined in the service agreement. Any non-refundable payments (such as setup fees, design costs, or custom development work) will not be refunded.</li>
        <li><strong>Milestone-based Payment Structure:</strong> If payments were made in milestones, refunds will only apply to unearned milestones based on the work completed at the time of cancellation.</li>
        <li><strong>Completed Projects:</strong> No refunds will be issued for completed projects where deliverables have been provided to the Client in accordance with the project scope. Any issues with the final deliverables should be addressed under the Warranty and Support terms outlined in the service agreement.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>b. Non-Refundable Fees</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Certain fees may be non-refundable and will be specified in the contract or Statement of Work (SOW). These may include:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Consultation or initial project setup fees</li>
            <li>Licensing fees for third-party software or tools purchased on behalf of the Client</li>
            <li>Custom development costs already incurred</li>
            <li>Expenses related to project resources or out-of-pocket costs that have been committed</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h3>c. Processing Time for Refunds</h3>
    <p>Once a refund has been approved, the refund will be processed within 180-240 business days, depending on the payment method used for the original transaction. Refunds will be issued through the same payment method used by the Client (e.g., credit card, bank transfer). Refund processing times may vary depending on the financial institution.</p>

    <h3>d. Refund Amounts</h3>
    <p>The refund amount will be calculated based on the scope of work completed up to the cancellation date and any non-refundable fees. In cases where services were bundled or provided at a discount, the refund will be adjusted based on the value of the services rendered up to that point.</p>

    <h2>3. Dispute Resolution</h2>
    <p>If the Client feels that the cancellation or refund is not handled fairly or in accordance with the terms of the agreement, they may contact us to resolve the issue. We will work in good faith to resolve any disputes related to refunds or cancellations.</p>
    <p>In the event that a resolution cannot be reached, the matter may be escalated to mediation or arbitration, as outlined in our Terms and Conditions.</p>
